Given the attached .h file implement the defined functions accordingly with the requirements (comments before each method)
The functions are implemented in the given .h file
Students ca test the functions in a different .cpp file. Students can also use the given Google Tests to asses their implementation (this is optionally)

What you are not allowed to do:
- change the functions header
- return dummy values that pass the Google tests 
- write main() or other functions in the .h file

Not complying with the previous rules, the submitted assignment will not be evaluated.

Students are encouraged to change ideas but is forbidden to share source code. All solutions will be cross-check with MOSS from Stanford. Students who upload solutions that contain more than 30% identical code (even if you rename variables is still considered identical) will loose the right to take the exam as they will loose their entire seminar points.

Maximum points per this assignment: 12 as there are 12 use cases (tests). Even if you don't use the Google tests you can check them.
